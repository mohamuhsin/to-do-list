# Simple-To-Do-List

**Project: Building a Simple To-Do List**

*Overview*: Create a basic to-do list using React components.

**Step 1:** Set up a new React app.

**Step 2:** Create a To-Do List component.

1. Inside the `src` folder, create a new file named `TodoList.js`.
2. Create a functional component that displays a list of to-do items.
3. Use JSX to render a list of items with checkboxes.

**Step 3:** Create a form for adding new to-do items.

1. Inside `TodoList.js`, add a form with an input field for entering new to-do items and a submit button.

**Step 4:** Implement basic interactivity.

1. Add state to your `TodoList` component to manage the list of to-do items.
2. Implement event handlers to add new items to the list when the form is submitted and update the state accordingly.

**Step 5:** Display and update the list.
**Step 6:** Style your app using css.


1. Use JSX to map over the list of to-do items and display them.
2. Implement the ability to mark items as completed by changing their styles when clicked.

These projects will help you and your groupmates practice JSX and React components without diving into more complex concepts like props and states. You can gradually progress from the basic JSX practice to building a simple to-do list application.
